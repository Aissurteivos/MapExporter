- Figure out how to track rooms that may be different between slugcats
	- Don't render slugcats that aren't different
	- Use predefined priority order
	- new RoomSettings(abstractRoom.name, world.region, false, false, null || slugcat name)
		- Without slugcat name doesn't check for any specific slugcat
		- Allows you to get placed objects
	- I think check for different exits too probably
		- See what can be reused from ReusedRooms
		- RegionInfo contains world connections
- Get rid of CaptureRegion (merge it into CaptureTask)
- Test
